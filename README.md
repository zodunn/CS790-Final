# CS790-Final

For our project based on the theme from the [2025 IEEE VR 3DUI contest](https://ieeevr.org/2025/contribute/3dui-contest/), "United for Planet Earth: Promoting Environmental Sustainability using Virtual Reality," our group developed a high-level concept for an engaging VR application aimed at educating users about proper recycling practices.

Our idea centered around an interactive VR recycling game where users are immersed in a virtual environment and challenged to correctly clean and sort various recyclable items into the appropriate bins—such as paper, plastic, metal, and glass. Items appear in different states of cleanliness and condition, requiring users to first identify whether they need cleaning before sorting.

The goal of the application is to promote environmental awareness by teaching users the importance of proper recycling habits in a fun, hands-on, and memorable way. By simulating real-life recycling scenarios in VR, the experience aims to increase users’ understanding of waste management and encourage more sustainable behavior in their everyday lives.
